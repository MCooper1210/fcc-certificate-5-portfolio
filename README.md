This repository contains the index.html and styles.css for the fifth freeCodeCamp course certificate, a landing page. For this, I am collating three of my projects into a portfolio page, with links to my other projects.

## Description

This certificate combines several html and css skills from previous courses into one page, such as a navbar, flexboxes, a footer and media queries.

The portfolio page contains a nav bar at the top of the viewport, followed by an image that covers the viewport with center aligned text. There is a section with links to previous projects, followed by a footer with my contact details and links to my github and email.
